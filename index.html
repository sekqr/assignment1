<p style="color:green"; id="p01">Still supplying the same goodness said to provide relaxation and a marked improvement to sleep quality and blood circulation,
 the hot spring is now channelled to a large “spa” area where park visitors can circle around and enjoy a dip.
At a toasty temperature of 40°C, soaking your bare feet in the water spells pure bliss.

<h2 title="Cooking of eggs"; style="color:darkorange;font-family:verdana;background-color:mintcream;">Cooking eggs</h2>

<img src="img5.jpg" alt="egg cooking" width="600" height="400" style="align:middle">
 
<pre>
Bring some eggs and fill your own bucket or pail up with 70°C spring water from the main collection point,
 after which you’ll be able to whip up a batch of jiggly soft-boiled eggs for the whole squad. 
Very reminiscent of the common egg-cooking practice throughout hot springs in Japan!Besides the sheer novelty of cooking real food in 
(A) a public park, and 
(B) an actual century-old hot spring which exists in Singapore,
 you can control the doneness of your egg based on how long you steep it in the water.
As a general guideline, 20 minutes or so will give you that glorious lava yolk with the egg whites still slightly runny. 
Nothing quite like slurping up some freshly boiled eggs from a naturally-occuring wonder. 
Your concoction might even have a slight magical flavour unlike everything you’ve prepared in a kitchen!
